connect-app
===========

### How to install ??
* Firsly you need to clone to repo 
* Like a good boy I've not packaged the dependencies, so you need to move into connect-app folder and hit 

```
npm install
```
* This installs the app dependencies which is only "connect" framework
* index.js is the main file to run

```
node index.js
```

* app now runs on port 4000
* naigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/home
